### ðŸ“œ Manifesto

We think education systems should allow *anyone* to learn *anything*, in *any way* *they want*, and get credentials *in any way they want*.

--

***Anyone***

Education systems should be as permission-less as possible. Today, that means open to anyone with a smart phone.

--

**Learn *anything***

We believe in interest-driven education systems. There should not be arbitrary restrictions to what one can learn.

--

**In *any way they want***

Students should have the option to learn in any way they want. A physical short-term course, a MOOC, and everything in between.

--

**Get credentials *in any way they want***

Members of the edu system should have the option to get credentials in any way they want. Producing an essay, some code, an academic paper, making a presentation, a YouTube video, sitting an exam â€” any way they can demonstrate their learning.
