## What will it be?

--

Solvio will be a decentralized education system

--

<!-- While there are large number of services that will together turn this vision into reality, here I'll talk about a particular three. Solvio Learn will be a personal curriculum producer. But it's not enough just to learn. The major problem today with self-learning is that there are very not effective ways to get credentials. Effective credentials are super important in the modern world as they work like signals. That is what makes this proposal not only a learning system, but an *education* system. 

Solvio Advance will be a decentralized credential provider. Finally, we a math step-by-step validator, which I currently call Provio. Note that all the names are provisional and should be decided collectively. Also, I use the word services because I think it's better to refer to a product as an end product (consumer/B2B). These services may have their own separate apps, or be part of a single app/product.  -->

Services:

- Solvio Learn - personal curriculum producer
- Solvio Advance - decentralized credential provider
- Provio - math step-by-step validator

## Solvio Learn

- A semantic aggreagtor, ranker and search engine for learning resources
<!-- Here I use learning resource in the most generalized sense, so could be online resources, real-life learning and work experience-->
<!-- Let's look at each in slightly more detail -->

--

Can be online resources
- Udemy
- Coursera
- Youtube
- Medium
- Kindle
- podcast
- a stackexchange answer + comments
<!-- I have recently self-taught myself a few technical topics like computability theory and cryptography. I found that I got the most insight by  -->

--

Currently
<!-- Currently, the web is very fragmented when it comes to recommending which way & in which order to learn -->
- fragmented
<!-- For the most common self-learning topics (programming) there exist "roadmap"s and awesomelists, mainly on github -->
- roadmaps

--

Solvio Learn will provide the following advantages:
- learn *anything*
- semantic aggregator
  - individual resources:
    - difficulty, possible lengths, quality
  - interaction
    - learning dependencies, soft and hard
    - allows for
    <!-- incl. jobs -->
- produce full learning path

--

<!-- Solvio Learn won't allow you to search online online resources. The learning resources can also be -->

Can also be real-life learning
- short-term intensive courses
- long-term (tri/semester/year-long)
- tutoring: physical, online 

<!-- Will be first commission-free tutoring/courses platform -->

--

Can also be work experiences
- Solvio
  - teaching
  - grading
- non-Solvio
  - programming
  - internships

---

So we've already said that learning is not enough and credentials are equally (if not more) important

The Solvio model will allow any "credential providers".
<!-- E.g. -->
- platforms like Udacity, Coursera
<!-- IXL, Brilliant, HackerRank -->
- websites like Khan Academy, Codecademy
<!-- and even -->
- credentials from legacy system

<!-- Now the first two points are informal sources, so we can really use those for our system. But they only offer credentials effectively in two areas: short-answer questions and coding. -->

<!-- Anything that is subjective (i.e. not understandable by a machine) - all of humanities and parts of the sciences as well, will have a problem. The solution to that will be called Solvio Advance. -->

<!-- Additionally, we will incorporate computer algebra into these platforms. The end result will be Provio. -->

---

## Solvio Advance

--

- A decentralized grading/credentialing system
- Numerous possibilities to offer/implement
  - Creating
    - E.g.
      - Essays
      - Science problems
      - Code
      - Podcast
      - Meetup presentations...
    - Get graded in a P2P manner
  - Teaching
  - Testing
    - Physical
    - Online
    - One-on-one

---

## Provio

--

A tool that will be able to "understand" math

<!-- While there are many applications, the most immediate ones are -->
- step-by-step math learning
  - currently websites like Khan Academy only check your answer
  - this will allow to check every step and give hints for the next step
<!-- - higher-level problems (most high school courses and olympiads, all uni courses) are proof-search rather than numerical-search questions -->
- high-level problems

--

<!-- So many beautiful things about this, lemme just mention a few -->
<!-- - A mathematical proof is synonymous with deductive reasoning and that is one of education's major goals. The ability for a student to learn math at their own pace, step-by-step, is powerful and imo will revolutionize math education -->
- Revolutionary
<!-- - Provio fits into both sides of Solvio: learning & credentialing -->
- Learning & credentialing
- Incredible value independently
<!-- - A product like this will have incredible value independently (I would be happy pursuing this as my startup if Solvio didn't exist). Could offer to: -->
  <!-- - schools for learning, hw, and testing -->
  - schools
  <!-- - universities for entrance exams, problem sets, and finals -->
  - universities
  - math olympiads (or start our own :P)
  - Khan Academy, Coursera...
<!-- on a business level, this could be the deciding factor in them deciding to integrate with Solvio credentialing

<!-- So now we've introduced the three main services: Solvio Learn, Solvio Advance and Provio. 

Now, You can see a few threads running through this discussion. Let's look at three -->

---

<!-- So I described an education model -->
<!-- An education model sits on top of a learning model -->
<!-- So what will be the specific learning model? -->

Solvio is most suitable for:
1. self-learning
2. short-term (intensive) courses
3. short-term work

There is ample evidence that short-term courses work better than long-term
<!-- For all subjects except languages and music -->
<!-- Can be more creative: language stay, music concert -->

Self-learning is limited by interest
<!-- or enthusiasm, but if that's present, it's undoubtedly the most cost- efficient way to learn -->

Most effective solutions should be built *for*.

Self-learning is not possible in current formal education, precisely because there isn't a credentialing system for it

--

A world with high tx costs will lead to full-time jobs

Low tx costs, freelancing becomes possible

Studies and personal experience show that freelancers are happier, more motivated and more productive

<!-- It makes sense if you can capture your entire value -->

We merely make it possible to freelance as a teacher or a student

Essentially, we want to normalize education to the current level technology

<!-- While we're talking about disruption theory: -->
<!-- value tends to be captured by service providers. That's why newspapers, hotels, taxi companies and universities must exist -->
<!-- value is accumulated by aggregators - those who control the entry point of the consumer experience -->

## End of Part 1

<!-- Now let's go more in depth -->

---

## Outline

<!-- Goal is to give you a deeper understanding of how I envision Solvio -->

<!-- Forgive me for not having everything worked out, I never actually work on this full-time (at most 1 day per week) -->

<!-- As such, this section contains much more speculation. The exact decisions will be determined by how things go and/or user testing -->
